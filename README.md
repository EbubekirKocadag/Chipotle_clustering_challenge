Find Chipotle **epicentres** to live your ideal Chipotle lifestyle by clustering the [Chipotle dataset](chipotle_locations.csv).
### Must-have features

- [X] A visualization of the USA with Chipotle locations
- [ ] Visualization of the different clusters
- [ ] Intrinsic analysis comparison of the clusters of at least 2 methods with varying arguments (using Euclidean distance as criteria)
- [ ] A chosen centroid to live. Make your argument of why the chosen centroid is superior to others. Examples of arguments are:
    - [ ] highest density
    - [ ] greatest uninterrupted link of Chipotle locations with smallest link-to-link distance
    - [ ] ...
- [ ] a GitHub page where results are visualized


### Nice-to-have features

- [ ] Color coded cluster visualization
- [ ] Clear graph legends
